pyIsis: python wrapper for Avid Management Console
==================================================

pyIsis is a python wrapper that try to mimic Avis Isis Management Console
web service. It can manipulate workspaces, users, groups and permissions.
It can also manage snapshots, etc...

It's my first module, so there is a lot of work to do.



Installing
----------

From the source:

```
./setup.py install
```

TODO:
-----
- Test workspace creation and deletion on ISIS 7000 and 5500
- Handle user permissions correctly
- Add documentations
- Add examples
- More pythonic style to do things...
